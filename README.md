# BLOGR Frontend

This will be home of UI component of the BLOGR Frontend Service.

This project uses [REACT](https://reactjs.org/) with Typescript, ESLint and Prettier.

## Frontend Overview

### Core Libraries
- React.Js
- Material UI
- Formik

# Getting Started
This setup guide is focused on helping you setup the BLOGR Frontend locally on your machine in development environment.

### Pre-requisite
- Clone the BLOGR Frontend Repo [here](https://github.com/adedoyintolu/blogr.git)

## Step 1
First thing you should do is navigate into the root directory of the project and run `yarn` in your terminal to install project dependencies. This will create a `node_modules` folder in the project root directory.

## Step 2
# Building without Containerizing

To work locally without using the docker setup run the following yarn commands;

- `yarn run build` builds the project
- `yarn start` to startup the webpack server in development mode with hot-module-reload activated.

Viola! You are good to go!
